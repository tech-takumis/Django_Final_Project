## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the Paw Bank application on your local machine:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [your-repo-url]
    cd paw-bank
    ```

2.  **Install Pipenv (if you don't have it):**

    ```bash
    pip install pipenv
    ```

3. **Navigate to project1 and project2 folder.**

    ```bash
      cd project1
    ```

    ```bash
      cd ../project2
    ```
4.  **Activate the Pipenv virtual environment**

    ```bash
    pipenv shell
    ```
5.  **Install dependencies in both project1 and project2:**

    ```bash
    pipenv install
    ```
6.  **Generate `.env` files and Keys:**

    -   Navigate to the root of `project2` and run the key generation script:

        ```bash
        cd project2
        python generate_key.py
        ```
        This will create `.env` file with necessary configurations, including `ENCRYPTION_KEY` and `JWT_SIGNING_KEY`.
         -   Navigate to the root of `project1` and run the key generation script:

        ```bash
        cd ../project1
        python generate_key.py
        ```
        This will create `.env` file with necessary configurations, including `SECRET_KEY`.

    -   **Important:** After generating keys for `project2`, you need to copy the following keys from `project2/.env` to `project1/.env`:

        -   `ENCRYPTION_KEY`
        -   `JWT_SIGNING_KEY`

        This ensures that both Project 1 and Project 2 use the same keys for cryptography and JWT, enabling the proper transfer of data between them.

7. **Navigate back to project2 and Apply migrations:**
    ```bash
        cd ../project2
        python manage.py migrate
    ```
8.  **Create super user**
  ```bash
        python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```
9.  **Run the development server in project1 and project2:**

    -   For `project1`:

       ```bash
        cd ../project1
        python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
        ```
    -    For `project2`

        ```bash
          cd ../project2
        python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8001
       ```
